#### Thoughts about the course so far:
The course assignments are quick to train, small scale models and help get a meaningful insight into working of Deep Neural Networks.

The videos and other material however aren't the best, and lack both depth and breadth. They cover a very minimal subset of what Deep Learning actually is. Anyone who is serious about learning should grab a decent book on the topic, and read papers/publications.
